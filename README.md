# HR-Analysis Dashboard
HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI
Project Description
This project demonstrates my ability to leverage data visualization and analytical tools to extract meaningful insights and make data-driven recommendations. The primary focus is to use HR analytics to monitor key metrics, understand employee attrition, and guide strategic decisions for improved retention. The dashboard identifies the main drivers behind employee turnover and provides actionable insights for HR teams.

Objectives
Monitor and analyze employee data to identify factors affecting attrition.
Develop reports that enable HR teams to take targeted actions for better employee retention.
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing relevant HR metrics.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: For creating and visualizing interactive dashboards.
Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For data manipulation and creating custom measures.
Data Cleaning and Preparation with Power Query
Connect to Data: Import the employee dataset into Power BI.
Data Cleaning:
Remove duplicates and rename columns for better clarity.
Adjust data types for consistency.
Transformation:
Create a standardized template for one data sheet and replicate it across all sheets.
Apply filters and conditions to extract relevant data.
Package the steps into reusable functions for future data processing.
Load Data: Load the transformed data into Power BI for analysis.
Data Exploration and Analysis Using DAX
DAX Functions: Used to create custom columns and measures for data aggregation (e.g., COUNT, SUM).
KPI Creation: Developed measures to improve the dashboard's key performance indicators (KPIs) and data exploration.
Dashboard Design and Visualization
Layout:
Crafted a user-friendly layout to enhance the visual appeal and navigability.
Visual Elements:
Integrated various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, column charts, cards, matrices, and donut charts.
Slicers:
Added a slicer for month selection to allow dynamic data filtering.
KPI Highlights:
Displayed key insights using measures and visual elements to enhance dashboard utility.
Key Insights
Analyzed employee data to identify trends affecting turnover.
Sales personnel showed a higher attrition rate, primarily due to lower salaries and minimal pay increases.
Provided detailed visualizations and specific recommendations to help the HR team develop effective retention strategies.
Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time data sources for continuous analysis.
Include predictive analytics for forecasting future employee attrition trends.
Conclusion
This HR analytics dashboard provides a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding employee turnover. It enables HR teams to identify critical factors leading to attrition and implement effective measures to improve retention. The dashboard's interactive elements and detailed analysis support data-driven decision-making.
